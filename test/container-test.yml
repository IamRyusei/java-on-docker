# This file defines the configuration for the Container Structure Test tool
# (https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test) which
# allows to test an existing Docker image.
#
# The goal of this test is to simply check if Java (either a JRE or JDK)
# is installed correctly.
#
# Author: Leonardo Spaccini <leonardo.spaccini.gtr@gmail.com>

# Note: for unknown reasons, some Java implementations prints 
# the output of the "java -version" command to the stderr...
# In this test it is just checked that the command returns with a zero,
# otherwise it means that Java is not installed correctly.
